# discordbotrb
A random discord bot in ruby

uses discordrb

change the rand(NUM) to however many lines are the the jokes.txt

I tried to get music to play in a voice channel, technically it (I think, I was messing around with changes so 
they may not be the correct lines of code) does but it is really choppy for me when I try so its there but not set up to run
